A typical example on profiling with yappi, includes at least 3 lines of code:

{{{
import yappi
def a(): 
    for i in range(10000000): pass

yappi.start()
a()
yappi.get_func_stats().print_all()
yappi.get_thread_stats().print_all()
}}}

And the output of running above script:

{{{
Clock type: cpu
Ordered by: totaltime, desc

name                                    #n         tsub      ttot      tavg
deneme.py:35 a                          1          0.296402  0.296402  0.296402

name           tid              ttot      scnt
_MainThread    6016             0.296402  1
}}}

Let's inspect the results in detail. So, first line:
{{{
Clock type: cpu
}}}
This indicates the profiling timing stats shown are retrieved using the CPU clock. That means the actual CPU time spent in the function is shown. Yappi provides two modes of operation: CPU and Wall time profiling. You can change the setting by a call to _yappi.set_clock_type()_ API. See [https://code.google.com/p/yappi/wiki/ClockTypes_v082 Clock Types] to interpret different timing values correctly.

Second is:
{{{
Ordered by: totaltime, desc
}}}
It is obvious. It shows the sort order and sort key of the shown profiling stats. You can see the valid values for this in _YFuncStats().sort()_ API.

Ok, now we actually see the statistic of the function a():
{{{
name                                    #n         tsub      ttot      tavg
deneme.py:35 a                          1          0.296402  0.296402  0.296402
}}}
Let's explain the fields in detail:
|| *Title* || *Description* ||
|| name || the full unique name of the called function. ||
|| #n || how many times this function is called. ||
|| tsub || how many time this function has spent in total, subcalls excluded. See [https://code.google.com/p/yappi/wiki/ClockTypes_v082 Clock Types] to interpret this value correctly. ||
|| ttot || how many time this function has spent in total, subcalls included. See [https://code.google.com/p/yappi/wiki/ClockTypes_v082 Clock Types] to interpret this value correctly. ||
|| tavg || how many time this function has spent in average, subcalls included. See [https://code.google.com/p/yappi/wiki/ClockTypes_v082 Clock Types] to interpret this value correctly. ||

The next lines shows the thread stats. So, let see:
{{{
name           tid              ttot      scnt
_MainThread    6016             0.296402  1
}}}
|| *Title* || *Description* ||
|| name || the class name of the Thread.(this is the name of the class inherits the threading.Thread class) ||
|| tid || the thread id. ||
|| ttot || how many time this thread has spent in total. See [https://code.google.com/p/yappi/wiki/ClockTypes_v082 Clock Types] to interpret this value correctly. ||
|| scnt || how many times this thread is scheduled. ||
